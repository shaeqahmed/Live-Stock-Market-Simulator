### Description

Users can populate their portfolio through purchasing and shorting stocks. A user is able to get a quote and analyze a ticker directly from the app through a screener that displays a graph and other informative data (high, low, moving averages, etc.). All data is pulled **live** from the stock market to ensure that the experience is as realistic as possible.

``` java -jar Stock.jar ```
